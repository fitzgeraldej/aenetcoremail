.Net Core C# version of the popular POP/IMAP Mail Client by Andy Edinborough

I have used Andy's original library on a number of project.  But recently I have been doing some work on .Net Core so as a learning curve I have decided to port Andy's library to .Net Core.

At this moment in time I dont know how long this will take as I will be doing this in my spare time. This is just the initial repository creation. As I build out the solution projects.

More details to follow as work progresses.
